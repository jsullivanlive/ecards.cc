=========

http://ecards.cc

With the popularity of memes and people making their own ecards, 
I figured it would be fun to make a site that is purely open source 
to create these.

### Deployment

Currently deployed at Heroku:  http://ecards.cc

### Development

Github Style:  Fork the repo and send a pull request.

Run it like this to get autoreload working.

    $ npm install --dev
    $ foreman start -f Procfile-dev

### Ads / Revenue

No plan at this time, but that could change in the future if hosting 
costs make it necessary.

### License

BSD and if you deploy it you have to link back to this github project page.
