ecards.cc
=========

With the popularity of memes and people making their own ecards, I figured it would be fun to make a site that is purely open source to create these.

### Deployment

The site will be initially deployed on a cloud provider.

### Ads / Revenue

There is no plan at this time to put ads on the site, but that may change in the future depending on hosting costs.  Of course, the site content will always be here in this public git repo, so if you ever want to copy the site without ads, you can easily run it locally or buy a domain name and run it yourself!
